# Sample Apparel EC App

This directory contains a minimal React Native (Expo) sample for an apparel e-commerce app. It demonstrates:

- Common codebase for iOS and Android.
- Fetching the user's GPS location using `expo-location`.
- Logging events to Google Analytics with `expo-firebase-analytics`.
- Four product categories with ten sample items each.
- Five articles displayed at the top of the app.

## Getting Started

1. Install Expo CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

You'll need Firebase Analytics configured for your project to send analytics events.
